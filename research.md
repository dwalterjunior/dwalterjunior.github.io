**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
*Today, the global population faces the urgent problem that our reliance on fossil fuels continues to damage the environment worldwide, and without adopting cleaner alternatives soon, the future will see worsening climate, making electricity from clean sources all the more necessary.*

By splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis, energy can be stored in the form of hydrogen fuel. When this hydrogen is later used in a fuel cell, it reacts with oxygen to produce electricity, releasing only water and heat. This approach offers a clean way to turn renewable energy sources into storable, usable power.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. In the fuel cell, hydrogen atoms are split into protons and electrons; the electrons travel through an external circuit to create electric current, while the protons move through a membrane and recombine with oxygen to form water. This process efficiently powers the vehicle and produces only water vapor and heat as emissions.

This article reviews how electrolysis can store renewable electricity by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. It highlights that the biggest challenge is improving the efficiency of the hydrogen and oxygen reactions, which currently waste energy. Researchers are developing better catalysts and membranes to make the process faster and more durable.

Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, producing clean hydrogen fuel when powered by renewable or low‑carbon electricity. This is done in an electrolyzer, which contains an anode, cathode, and electrolyte. By converting electricity into storable hydrogen, electrolysis enables a flexible, zero‑emission way to produce energy, and ongoing research aims to make it more efficient, durable, and cost‑effective.
